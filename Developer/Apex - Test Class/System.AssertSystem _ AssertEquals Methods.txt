What is the use of System.Assert/System.AssertEquals Methods?

These methods are used to ensure that the Apex code executes and returns the 
expected value.

System.Assert: 
=============
It accepts two parameter: First one (mandatory) is the condition 
test and the second one is used to display a message in case the condition fails.
Syntax: System.assert(var1 == var2,”msg”)

System.AssertEquals:
================== 
It accepts three parameters; the first two (mandatory) are
the variables that will be tested for equality or inequality, and the third (optional)
one is used to display a message in case the condition fails.
Syntax: System.assertEquals(var1, var2,”msg”);
