What is the use of System.runAs() method?

All Apex code runs in system mode, where the permissions and record sharing of
the current user are not taken into account. The system method runAs enables
us to write test methods that change the user context to an existing user or a 
new user so that the user’s record sharing is enforced. The runAs method doesn’t
enforce user permissions or field-level permissions, only record sharing.
The following items use the permissions granted by the user specified with runAs
running as a specific user:
 
Dynamic Apex Methods using with sharing or without sharing 


Shared records
The original permissions are reset after runAs completes.The runAs method 
ignores user license limits.
