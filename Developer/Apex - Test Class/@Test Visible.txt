What is @testVisible used for while testing an Apex class?

There could be a possibility that we need to access a private class member, but due to its accessibility, it is not visible to test method. To make them visible to test method we use @Testvisible before any private member in Apex class.


Some methods are declared as private so we won’t be able to call them outside
the class. However, sometimes we really want to be able to invoke it from a unit
test method.

To resolve this, we can mark the method with a @TestVisible annotation. Then
 although it is still private, it is invokable from our unit test methods.
