What is test class and why it is necessary?

A test class is a class which helps in checking the quality of code before it can be deployed to Salesforce Production. 

To check your business functionality weather our logic is working fine or not

If you want to move your code to production then code coverage should be 75%

We should give an annotation @isTest for the class. (Annotation means salesforce will understand we are going to write test class)

1 Positive behaviour
