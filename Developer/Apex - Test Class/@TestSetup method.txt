Thinks to remember when you use @testSetup method

1. We can use only one test setup method per class.
2. Test setup method will execute first in the test class.
3. If any DML error occurs in this test setup method, rest of the method not executed.
4. If a test setup method calls a non-test method of another class, no code coverage is calculated for the non-test method.
