# Apex Test Classes

This repository contains my personal notes, examples, and practice code for **Apex Test Classes** in Salesforce.

These test classes are written to help understand how to test triggers, classes, and methods in Salesforce using best practices like test data creation, @isTest annotations, and bulk testing.

Useful for learning, debugging, and improving code quality by ensuring good test coverage.
