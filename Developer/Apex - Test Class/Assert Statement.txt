What are the assert statements?

What is the purpose?

To compare Actual value and Expected value we use assert statements.

Types of assert statements

system.assertEquals(val1,val2): If both val1 and val2 are same then test class run successfully otherwise test class will fail.
system.assertNotEquals(val1,val2): If both val1 and val2 are not same then test class run successfully otherwise test class will fail.
system.assertEquals(val1> val2): If the condition satisfied then test class run successfully otherwise test class will fail.
