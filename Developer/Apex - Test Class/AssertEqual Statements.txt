How many types of Assert Statements are there and what is their purpose?

Assert statements are used to compare expected value with the actual value.

There are three types of assert statements :

1. assertEquals(expVal, actVal) -->  returns true if expVal Matches actVal.

2. assertNotEqual(expVal, actVal) -->  returns true if expVal does not match actVal.

3. assertEquals(expVal > actVal) -->  returns true if the condition is satisfied.
