What to Test In Apex?

Salesforce.com recommends the following components need to test.

1. Single Records:
This includes testing to verify that a single record produces the correct,
expected result.

2. Bulk Records:
Any apex code, whether a triggers, a class or on extension may be used 
for 1to 200 records we must test not only the single record case, but the bulk
cases as well.

3. Positive scenarios:
This type of component testing expect a system to save a record without error.

4. Negative scenarios:
This type of component testing expect a system to give error.

5. Restricted User:
Test whether a user with restricted access to the objects used in code sees
the expected behavior, i.e whether they can run the code or receive error 
messages.
