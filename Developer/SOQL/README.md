# SOQL & SOSL Notes

This repository contains my personal notes and examples related to **SOQL (Salesforce Object Query Language)** and **SOSL (Salesforce Object Search Language)**.
These notes help me understand how to query and search data in Salesforce effectively using real-world scenarios and use cases.
Great for quick reference, practice, and revision while working on Apex or admin tasks.
