You can control the flow of program by using conditional constructs. 

There are two types fo conditional constructs are:

1. If_else statement control the flow of program based on the evaluation of the boolean expression.

Only one else statement is allowed in the if_else chain.  

if (Condition)
{
	statement;
}
else
{
	statement;
} 
 

1.	if statement
An if statement consists of a Boolean expression followed by one or more statements.

2	if...else statement
An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.

3	if...elseif...else statement
An if statement can be followed by an optional else if...else statement, which is very useful to test various conditions using single if...else if statement.

4	nested if statement
You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).
