Operator Overloading:- The operator like +,-,* are performing operation on standard data type. But C# provide us technique all these operator to operate on user defined data type.And user defined data type behave as a standard data type.

we can add two variable of user defined data type with the same syntax that is applied to the basic data type.

This is called operator overloading.

<access_specifier> class_name operator + (parameter list)
{
 code;
} 

we can extend only operator functionality in operator overloading but we can not change their orignal task.
