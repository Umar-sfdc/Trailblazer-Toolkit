What are the Salesforce best practices for apex?


1. Use Asynchronous Apex methods like @future methods, batch processing, scheduler that does not need to be executed synchronously.
2. Asynchronous Apex should be “bulkified”. It means able to handle collections of records.
3. Apex code must have appropriate exception handling.
4. When querying large data sets use SOQL “for” loop.
5. Use SOSL over SOQL where possible because it is much faster than SQL.
6. Avoid hitting governor exceptions in apex methods.
7. No SOQL or SOSL queries inside loops. If you need to query, query once, retrieve all the necessary data in a single query, then iterate over the results.
8. No DML statements inside loops.
9. No Asynchronous methods inside loops.
10. Do not use hardcoded IDs.
