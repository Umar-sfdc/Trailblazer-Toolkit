VisualForce Components:
=====================

Each visualforce page contains two components.
1. VisualForce Markup:
	It contains a set of VisualForce Tags, has been used to design the user interface.
	Each VisualForce Tag is a Dependent Tag, i.e. each starting tag should requires an ending tag.
	VisualForce Tags are not case sensitive.
	Each VisualForce Page Tag should be prefixed with the word "apex".
	
	Ex:
		<apex:page>
			....
			....
		</apex:page>
	
	Each Tag contains one or more attributes, which are used to supply the input values.
	
2. VisualForce Controller:
	It contains the corresponding business logic, using by the visualforce page controles.
	It can be implemented by using "Apex, SOQL, SOSL, DML" statements.
	
	Note: A visualforce page can reference one or more controller classes.
