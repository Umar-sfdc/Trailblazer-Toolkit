Best Practices to reduce the view state size

         Minimize number of form on a page.  Use apex:actionRegion instead of using 2 or more forms.
         Refine your SOQL to only retrieve the data needed by the page.
         All public and private data members present in Standard, Custom and Controller extensions are saved.
         Mark any Apex variables that are not necessary to the view state as Transient. (The transient variables are not passed to view state and therefore not stored in View State)
         Create wizards with as few pages as possible
         Use outputLink components instead of commandLink or commandButton components where possible as they don뭪 need to be nested in a form.
