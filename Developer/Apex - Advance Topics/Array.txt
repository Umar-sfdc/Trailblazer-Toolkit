Array is a reference type and data type.

An array stored a fixed size.

Array is a collection of similer data type. you need to use the new keyword to create the instance of an array.

The variable of an array are called array element. Array element are accessed using a single name.

Index number representing the positioning of the array element within the array. Indexing of array begin with 0.

There are two type of array
1. Single-Dimensional Array: In a single dimentional array the value are stored in a row.
int [] score = new int[5];

2. Multi-Dimensional Array: In a multi-dimentional array the value are stored in a row and column format.
Multi dimentional array is also known as rectangular array. It can be two dimentional or three dimentional.

int[,] arr = new int[3,3];
  
There are two types of multidimentional array:
(i) Rectangle array: Each row will contain and equal number of column. Ex. (3,3 Matrix)
(ii) Jugged array: The element of jugged array can be of different dimensions and size.


Syntax:

<String> [] arrayOfProducts = new List<String>();

//Defining array
String [] arrayOfProducts = new List<String>();

//Adding elements in Array
arrayOfProducts.add('HCL');
arrayOfProducts.add('H2SO4');
arrayOfProducts.add('NACL');
arrayOfProducts.add('H2O');
arrayOfProducts.add('N2');
arrayOfProducts.add('U296');

for (Integer i = 0; i<arrayOfProducts.size(); i++) {
   //This loop will print all the elements in array
   system.debug('Values In Array: '+arrayOfProducts[i]);
}



Accessing array element by using index
You can access any element in array by using the index

//Accessing the element in array
//We would access the element at Index 3
System.debug('Value at Index 3 is :'+arrayOfProducts[3]);
