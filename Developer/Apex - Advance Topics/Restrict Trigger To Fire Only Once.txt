How to restrict Trigger to fire only once?


A trigger can fire twice, once before workflow and once after workflow.

The before and after triggers fire one more time only if something needs to be updated. If the fields have already been set to a value, the triggers are not fired again.

Workaround:

Add a static boolean variable to a class, and check its value within the affected triggers.

view sourceprint?
public class HelperClass {
   public static boolean firstRun = true;
}
trigger affectedTrigger on Account (before delete, after delete, after undelete) {

    if(Trigger.isBefore){

        if(Trigger.isDelete){

            if(HelperClass.firstRun){

                Trigger.old[0].addError('Before Account Delete Error');

                HelperClass.firstRun=false;
            }
        }
    }
}
