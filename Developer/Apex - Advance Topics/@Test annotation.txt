What is @isTest annotation? When you will use it?


When you define method or class using @isTest annotation then it only contains code used for testing your application. Test classes should be public or private only. Test class doesn't count against your organization limit of 3 MB for all Apex code.
@isTest
private class MyTestClass {
   // Methods for testing
   @isTest static void test1() {
      // Implement test code
   }
}
