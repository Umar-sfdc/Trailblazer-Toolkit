BestPractice of Visualforce page
================================

1. Do not hardcode picklists in Visualforce pages; include them in the controller instead.

2. Javascript and CSS should be included as Static Resources allowing the browser to cache them.

3. Refer all CSS on the top of the page and the script tags at the bottom of the page. This helps in improving the performance of the pages.

4. Mark controller variables as “transient” if they are not needed between server calls. This will make your page load faster as it reduces the size of the View State :View State Size: 135kb.

5. Use to iterate over large collections.

6. Allow cache the icon graphics and images frequently used for fast loading of vf page.

7. Do not use soql queries in getters and setters. This would affect the performance of the page.
