Using the this Keyword
There are two different ways of using the this keyword.
You can use the this keyword in dot notation, without parenthesis, to represent the current instance of the class in which it appears.
Use this form of the this keyword to access instance variables and methods. For example:
public class myTestThis {
string s;
{
this.s = 'TestString';
}
}
In the above example, the class myTestThis declares an instance variable s. The initialization code populates the variable using the
this keyword.
Or you can use the this keyword to do constructor chaining, that is, in one constructor, call another constructor. In this format, use
the this keyword with parentheses.
