Datatype means types of data.

Apex supports the following data types -

(i) Primitive (Integer, Double, Long, Date, Datetime, String, ID, or Boolean)
(ii) Collections (Lists, Sets and Maps)
(iii) sObject
(iv) Enums
(v) Classes, Objects and Interfaces

Primitive Data Types
=================

Integer:
======
A 32-bit number that does not include any decimal point. The value range for this starts from -2,147,483,648 and the maximum value is up to 2,147,483,647.

Integer barrelNumbers = 1000;
system.debug(' value of barrelNumbers variable: '+barrelNumbers);

Boolean
=======
This variable can either be true, false or null.

Boolean shipmentDispatched;
shipmentDispatched = true;
System.debug('Value of shipmentDispatched '+shipmentDispatched);

Date
====
This variable type indicates a date. This can only store the date and not the time. For saving the date along with time, we will need to store it in variable of DateTime.

Date ShipmentDate = date.today();
System.debug('ShipmentDate '+ShipmentDate);

Long
====
This is a 64-bit number without a decimal point. This is used when we need a range of values wider than those provided by Integer.

Long companyRevenue = 21474838973344648L;
system.debug('companyRevenue'+companyRevenue);

String
=====
String is any set of characters within single quotes. It does not have any limit for the number of characters.

String companyName = 'Abc International';
System.debug('Value companyName variable'+companyName);
