MVC Architecture:
=================

MVC is popular as it isolates the application logic from the user interface layer and supports separation of concerns.

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller. 

Each of these components are built to handle specific development aspects of an application. 

MVC is one of the most frequently used industry-standard web development framework to create scalable and extensible projects.

	Model : 
		It describes, how the data has been organized in the backend. Model represents the Data Structure with the help of Database Tables. 
		Ex: 
			Standard Objects, Custom Objects, Fields and Relationships
	
	View:
		It represents the Presentation / Front End / View part of the application.
		- It describes, how the Data is represented in the USer Interface.
___		Ex: 
			Page Layouts, Tabs --> Standard User Interfaces
			VF Pages --> Custom User Interfaces
			
	Controller:
		Controller is used to perform the actions on the objects and represent the data and results in the user interface.
		- This is also referred as "Business Logic"
		Ex:
			Standard Business Logic : Validation Rules, Workflow Rules, Approval processes, etc.
		
			Custom Business Logic: Apex Classes, Trigger, SOQL, SOSL, etc.
