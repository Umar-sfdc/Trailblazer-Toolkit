Using the super Keyword
The super keyword can be used by classes that are extended from virtual or abstract classes. By using super, you can override constructors and methods from the parent class.

Best Practices for Using the super Keyword
• Only classes that are extending from virtual or abstract classes can use super.
• You can only use super in methods that are designated with the override keyword.
