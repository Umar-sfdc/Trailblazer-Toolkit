Using the final Keyword

You can use the final keyword to modify variables.
• Final variables can only be assigned a value once, either when you declare a variable or in initialization code. You must assign a value
to it in one of these two places.
• Static final variables can be changed in static initialization code or where defined.
• Member final variables can be changed in initialization code blocks, constructors, or with other variable declarations.
• To define a constant, mark a variable as both static and final.
• Non-final static variables are used to communicate state at the class level (such as state between triggers). However, they are not
shared across requests.
• Methods and classes are final by default. You cannot use the final keyword in the declaration of a class or method. This means
they cannot be overridden. Use the virtual keyword if you need to override a method or class.
