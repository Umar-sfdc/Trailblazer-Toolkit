Where to write Visualforce code?


You can write the code basically in 3 ways.
1.     setup->App Setup->Develop->Pages and create new Visulaforce page.
2.     Setup -> My Personal Information -> Personal Information -> Edit check the checkbox development mode. When you run the page like this, https://ap1.salesforce.com/apex/MyTestPage.you will find the Page editor at the bottom of the page. You can write you page as well as the controller class associated with it, there itself.
3.     Using Eclipse IDE you can create the Visulaforce page and write the code.
