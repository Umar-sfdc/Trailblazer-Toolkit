Multiple inheritance is not supported by C#, to achieve this functionality we use interface concept. IN interface a single class can implement multiple interface.

An interface is look like a class.

An interface contain only declaration of the method, properties, events but not the implementation.

An interface can not contain any variable, constructor, destructor.

A class can implement more then one interface.

An interface can be defined using the interface keyword.  The declaration of interface is similer to the class declaration.

public interface interface_name
{
method declaration;
}

An interface in C# is a reference type.

All the member of an interface are abstract & public.

An interface can not contain constructor or destructor.

Interface member can not be declare static.
