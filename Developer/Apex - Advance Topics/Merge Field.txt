What are Merge fields? Explain with example?

Merge fields are fields that we can put in Email templates, mail merge templates, custom link or formula fields to incorporate values from a record.
Example: {!CustomObject.FieldName__c}



Will Visual force still supports the merge fields usage like S-control?

Just like S-Controls, Visualforce Pages support embedded merge fields, like the {!$User.FirstName} used in the example.
