What is the purpose of writing the test class?

After developing an apex class or apex trigger we should write the unit tests and ensure that we are able to execute at least 75% of the lines of code. 

If you are moving the code from sandbox to sandbox regarding code coverage you won't face any issue. 

If you are moving the code from sandbox to production, you need to include all the test classes at the time of deployment and salesforce will run all the test classes which you included for the deployment as well as test classes which are already present in production, if the code coverage is less than 75% deployment will fail.
