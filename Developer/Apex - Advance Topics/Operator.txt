Operator is a special symbol that perform a operation on operands.

Example: x + y, here is x & y is operand and + is operator.

There are 5 types of operator are:
(1.) Arithmatic Operator:
Arithmatic operation are used to perform arithmatic operation such as addition, subtraction, division, multiplication. 

Modulo return the reminder value when one number is divisible by another.

int a, b;

a = 10;
b = 20;

(a+b), (a-b), (a*b), (a/b), (a%b)

(2.) Logical Operator: Logical operator are used to perform some logical operation such as and, or, not. Logical operator are used in decesion making and loops.

And, Or, Not
 
(3.) Unary Operator: Unary operator are used to increment or decrement the value of an operand by 1.

PreIncrement:
x = 10;
y = ++x;

x = 11;
y = 11;

PostIncrement:
x = 10;
y = x++;

x = 11;
y = 10;


(4.) Comparison Operator: Comparison operator are used to check the relationship between two operands. If the relationship is true the result will be true otherwise it will result in false.

int a, b;
a = 10;
b = 20;

(a == b), (a = b), (a > b), (a < b), (a >= b), (a <= b), (a != b)

(5.) Arithmatic Assignment Operator: Are used to perform arithmatic operator and assign the result to a variable.

int a = 10;

(a += b), (a -= b)
