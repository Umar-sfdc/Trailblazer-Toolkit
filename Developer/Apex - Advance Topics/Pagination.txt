What is pagination and what are the ways to achieve it?

Assume that we need to display 100 records on the page. If the requirement is to display only 10 records at a time - 

First: Displays first set of 10 records.
Previous: Displays previous set of 10 records.
Next: Displays next set of 10 records.
Last: Displays last set of 10 records. 

We can achieve the pagination in two ways-
Using standardSetController
Using Limit and Offset keywords in SOQL query.
