What is the Salesforce Trigger best Practice


1. There should only be one trigger for each object because you can’t manage the order of execution of multiple triggers on single object.

2. Avoid complex logic in triggers. For testing and reuse, you should create Apex classes which contain the actual execution logic.

3. Methods should be bulkified.

4. Triggers should be “bulkified” and be able to process up to 200 records for each call.

Execute DML statements using collections instead of individual records per DML statement.

For Example:
List acclist; // Collection of records
Update acclist; //DML Operation. 

5. Use Collections in SOQL “WHERE” clauses to retrieve all records back in single query.

For Example: Set Ids;
SOQL=[Select Id,Name From Account WHERE Id IN :Ids];
Use a consistent naming convention including the object name (e.g., AccountTrigger)
