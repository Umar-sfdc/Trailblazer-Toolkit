We are used loop to execute a block of statement or code repetively.

There are three types of loops are:

(1.) While loop: while loop always check the condition first before execute the statement.

while(condition)
{
	statement;
}
 
(2.) Do While loop: Do while loop always execute the statement at least once and after that check the condition.

do 
{
	statement;
} 
while(condition);


(3.) For loop: Is used to execute a block of statement or code for a specific number of time. 

for (initialization; condition; increment/ decrement)
{
	Statement;
} 

(4.) Foreach Loop: Foreach loop is similer to the for loop implementation is different.

This loop access the data from the source one by one and we have no need to mentoned the lenght of the foreach loop. It can be acess by itself.

foreach (datatype variable_name in expression)
{
	Statement;
}
