Question # 39. What are the different AJAX action tags? What does each do?

Answer #

actionStatus: used to display start and stop statuses of AJAX requests.

actionSupport: used to call a second component when an event happens to the first component.

actionPoller: similar to actionSupport, but the event is based on a timer instead of a user action.

actionFunction: provides support for invoking a controller action from JavaScript code using an AJAX request by defining a new JavaScript function.

actionRegion: used to demarcate which parts of the page the server should reprocess.
