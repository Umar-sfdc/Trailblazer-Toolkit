What is @testSetup annotation? When you will use it?
For example, we have a test class, It has two test methods and each test method required 5 account records.So without creating 5 records for each test method, we will create a new method with annotation @testSetup then create only 5 account records. These records can access all test methods using SOQL query in that test class.   
Ex: @testSetup method
@testSetup static void setup() {
    // Create common test accounts
    List<Account> accountsLst = new List<Account>();
    for(Integer i=0;i<5;i++) {
  testAccts.add(new Account(Name = 'TestAc '+i));
    }
    Insert accountsLst;      
}

Thinks to remember when you use @testSetup method:
We can use only one test setup method per class.
Test setup method will execute first in the test class.
If any DML error occurs in this test setup method, rest of the method not executed.
If a test setup method calls a non-test method of another class, no code coverage is calculated for the non-test method.
