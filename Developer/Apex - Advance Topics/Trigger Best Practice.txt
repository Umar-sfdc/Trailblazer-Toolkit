What is the Salesforce Trigger best Practice


1. There should only be one trigger for each object.

2. Avoid complex logic in triggers. To simplify testing and resuse, triggers should delegate to Apex classes which contain the actual execution logic.

3. Avoid SOQL Queries or DML statements inside FOR Loops

4. Bulkify your Helper Methods

5. Using Collections, Streamlining Queries, and Efficient For Loops

6. Streamlining Multiple Triggers on the Same Object

7. Use of the Limits Apex Methods to Avoid Hitting Governor Limits

8. Use @future Appropriately

9. Writing Test Methods to Verify Large Datasets

10. Avoid Hardcoding IDs

11. Trigers should be "bulkified" and be able to process up to 200 records for each call.
