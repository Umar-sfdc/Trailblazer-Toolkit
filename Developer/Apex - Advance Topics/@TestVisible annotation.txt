4. What is @testVisible annotation? When you will use it?
For example, If you have an Apex class or controller, It has a Private or Protected variable or methods or inner classes. so you can't access them in other classes. But using this @testVisible annotation in a Private or Protected variable or methods or inner classes safely expose them only for test classes.
