(14.) What is a Test.setCreatedDate? When you will use it?
Sometimes we need test data like record created date in past. So we will use Test.setCreatedDate to set the created date meet our requirements. It only used in test classes.
Ex:
Account ac = new Account(name='test ac');
Insert ac;
Test.setCreatedDate(ac.Id, DateTime.newInstance(2015,01,01));
