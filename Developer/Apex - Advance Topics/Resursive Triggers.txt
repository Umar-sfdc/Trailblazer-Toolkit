What are Resursive triggers?
If any trigger calls itself then such triggers are called Recursive Triggers.

There is a possibility that the result of trigger can end up calling the same trigger again and can run in a loop, this is known as a recursive trigger. To avoid this scenario we should create a static variable and check the value of this variable before we execute anything in the trigger.

class:
public class AvoidRecursive {
   public static boolean firstRun = true;
}


Trigger: 
trigger TestTrigger on Contact (after insert) {
    if(AvoidRecursive.firstRun)
    {
        AvoidRecursive.firstRun = false;
        insert new Contact(Lastname=’Venu’, Phone=12345);
    }   
}


How to handle Recursive triggers?
We can handle these recursive Triggers using "Static Boolean".
