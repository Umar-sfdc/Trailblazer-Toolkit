Advantages of Batch Apex in Salesforce
=======================================
1. Whenever a transaction is executed, Batch Apex ensures that the code stays within the governor limit.

2. Until a batch is not successfully executed, Batch Apex won’t execute the following batches.

3. A large set of records can be processed together on a regular basis using Batch Apex classes.

4. The interface can be scheduled to run batches at different time periods.

5. Asynchronous operations can be implemented by Batch Apex classes.

6. Batch jobs are invoked programmatically during the runtime and can be operated on any size of records, with a maximum of 200 records per batch. You can break down a larger record data into 200 records per batch to execute it better.

7. Every transaction starts with a new set of governor limits.

8. If one batch fails to process successfully, all other successful batch transactions aren’t rolled back.
