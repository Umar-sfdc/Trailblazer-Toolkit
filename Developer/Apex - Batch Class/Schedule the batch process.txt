Schedule the batch process
==========================

By using this approach, we can make the batch job will get run on the specified time based on the period interval's specified by the user.

We need to create a seperate class, by implementing an interface called as "System.schedulable"

Global class ScheduleMyBatchJOb implements system.Schedulable
{

}

system.Schedulable interface contain a method calles as "execute", which will be invoked automatically upon the scheduling time.

Global class ScheduleMyBatchJOb implements system.Schedulable
{
	Global void execute(System.schedulableContext Scon)
	{
		// Call the batch job
	}

}
