There are various reasons why Batch Apex is better than normal Apex.

SOQL queries: Normal Apex uses 100 records per cycle to execute SOQL queries. Whereas, Batch Apex does the same in 200 records per cycle.

Retrieval of SOQL queries: Normal Apex can retrieve 50,000 SOQL queries but, in Batch Apex, 50,000,000 SOQL queries can be retrieved.

Heap size: Normal Apex has a heap size of 6 MB; whereas, Batch Apex has a heap size of 12 MB.

Errors: When executing bulk records, Normal Apex classes are more vulnerable to encountering errors as compared to Batch Apex.
