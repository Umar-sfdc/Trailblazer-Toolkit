# Salesforce Batch Classes

This repository contains my personal notes, examples, and practice code for **Salesforce Batch Apex Classes**.
These batch classes are written to help understand how to handle large data processing asynchronously using best practices like chunking, scope control, and test coverage.
Useful for learning how to build efficient, scalable batch processes that work well in Salesforce.


***ðŸš€ Keep Exploring, Keep Building!***  
Batch Apex is not just about processing data â€“ itâ€™s about designing smart, reliable jobs.  
Stay focused, stay curious, and master asynchronous processing like a pro!
