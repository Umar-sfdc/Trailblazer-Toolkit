By default Batch process is stateless. For each and every batch governor limit will be reset.

i.e. it will not remember the information about the previous batch in the next batch.

For each batch of record, the governor limit get reset to zero by default.

To carry forward the result from the one batch to another batch, we have to make the batch process as "statefull" by implementing an interface called as "Database.Statefull".

We can able to remember the previous batch operation result in the next batch.

Syntax:
=======
Global class <ClassName> implements database.Bachable<SObject>.Database.Statefull
{
	//Write the code
}
