1. Array supports to store only Hmogeneous(Similar type) elements.
	
2. Array size can't be grow / shrink at runtime. 
	
3. Arrays Supports Static Memory Allocation, Which causes the memory wastage.
	
4. Array doesn't provide the readymade methods to manage the elements.

To avoid the above problems, Apex provides a set of collection classes to manage the bulk records.


1. Collections supports to store both Homogeneous and Heterogeneous elements.

2. Collections supports dynamic memory allocation, Which allows the collection size can grow / shrink at runtime.

3. Collections provides a set of readymade methods to manage the elements.
