Apex Programming
=================

Apex programming language is the world's first cloud based and object oriented programming language.

Each business logic should be implemented interm of "Classes & Objects".

By using this programming language, we can implement the complex validation rules and the complex transactional flow.

Each statement in the apex programming should be ends with a "semi colon".

Apex is tightly coupled with programming language. we need to define the variables before it's usage.

By using apex programming language, we can built the custom business logic.

By using apex, we can perform all the DML (Insert, Update, Delete, Upsert, Undelete) manipulations in the salesforce object.

Apex programming is tightly integrated with "Salesforce objects".

By using apex programming, we can retreive the record from the salesforce objects with the help of "SOQL queries".

By using apex, we can integrate the salesforce application with the external systems with the help of "REST / SOAP API".

Each apex programming code / statement, should be compiled and executed by the application server inside the force.com platform.

Apex is not a case-sensitive programming.
