Array
-------
	
Arrays are used to store a collection of homogeneous elements inside a single variable.

i.e. Inside an array we can store a collection of similer data type element.
	
Arrays doesn't support to store heterogenous(Different datatype) elements.
	
Array are comes under the primitive data type, array are also supporting the static memory allocation.
	
The variable of an array are called array element. Array element are accessed using a single name.

Index number representing the positioning of the array element within the array. Indexing of array begin with 0.
	
Note: 
	Upon defining an array,we need to specify the size of the array. Which is used to calculate the required amount of memory to be allocated to the array variable.

Note:
	Arrays will supports "Static Memory Allocation". Hence array size cannot be grow/ shrink at runtime. (i.e. we can't increase the size of array at runtime.)
	
	
Syntax:
	<Datatype>[] <arrayName> = new <Datatype>[<Size>];
		
Example:
	
	Integer[] customerIDs = new Integer[10]; --> It can cable to hold max. of 10 Integer elements.
	
	string[] countryNames = new string[20]; --> It can able to hold max. of 20 string elements.
	
	Account[] accountRecords = new Account[5]; --> It can able to hold 5 Account records data.
	
	Position__c[] positionRecords = new Position__C[15]; --> It can able to hold max of 15 Position records.		
						
Note:
	For all arrays elements, memory will be allocated in contegeous memory locations(Side by side).
	
	To identity each element in the array,  we have to use "Index positions", which are starting from "Zero".
	
	Each partition in the array will be identitied by using "Array Name and Index Position".
	
	Syntax:
		<ArrayVariableName>[<index position>];
		
	Ex:
		customerIDs[0];
		customerIDs[1];
		customerIDs[2], ...etc.
	
	To assign the value or to retrieve the value from the array, we have to use index positions.

		
Assigning Values:
-------------------
	Integer[] customerIds = new integer[5];
	
		customerIDs[0] = 100;
		customerIDs[1] = 200;
		customerIDs[2] = 300;
		customerIDs[3] = 780;
		customerIDs[4] = 60;
	
------------------------------------------------------------	
   |  100  |  200	|  300	| 	780	  |  60	  |
------------------------------------------------------------	
Index: 0	1	   2		 3           4
	

To retrieve the values from the array, we have to use index positions as below.
	
	
Retrieving the array elements:
----------------------------------
	system.debug('First Element is...: '+ customerIDs[0] );
	system.debug('Second Element is...: '+ customerIDs[1] );
	system.debug('Third Element is...: '+ customerIDs[2] );
	system.debug('Fourth Element is...: '+ customerIDs[3] );
	system.debug('Fifth Element is...: '+ customerIDs[4] );
