This is a special data type in Salesforce. sObject is nothing but any object that stored in the force.com platform database we called as sObject.
sObject is a generic datatype which we can put anything. Means In sObject you can put object of any type.


There are two types of sObjects â€“ Standard and Custom.

For example, Account is a standard sObject and any other user-defined object (like Customer object that we created) is a Custom sObject.


//Declaring an sObject variable of type Account
Account objAccount = new Account();

//Assignment of values to fields of sObjects
objAccount.Name = 'ABC Customer';
objAccount.Description = 'Test Account';
System.debug('objAccount variable value'+objAccount);

//Declaring an sObject for custom object APEX_Invoice_c
APEX_Customer_c objCustomer = new APEX_Customer_c();

//Assigning value to fields
objCustomer.APEX_Customer_Decscription_c = 'Test Customer';
System.debug('value objCustomer'+objCustomer);


Ex:
		Account acc = new Account();
			acc.Name = 'Sample Account Record';
			acc.Rating = 'Hot';
			acc.Industry = 'Banking';
			acc.Type = 'Prospect';
			acc.AnnualRevenue = 100000;
			acc.active__C = 'Yes';
		
		Position__c pos = new Position__c();
			pos.Name = 'Test Manager';
			pos.Position_status__c = 'New Position';
			pos.Location__c = 'Bangalore';
			pos.open_date__C = system.Today();
			pos.Close_date__c = system.today().Adddays(30);
