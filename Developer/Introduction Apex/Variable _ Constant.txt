Variable
---------

Variable is a location in the memory that is used to store the value and the value could be integer or character. 

Variable can hold only single value at a time. And the value can be changed if requierd.

Variable are used to store the value temporarily for some time, to perform some operation. 

Each variable is associated with a datatype.

Syntax:
		[Access Specifier] <Data Type> <Variable Name> = <Value>;
		
		integer customerID;
		string customerName;
		string customerAddress;
		string customerEmailId;
		
		Boolean isCustomerActive;
		decimal balanceAmount;
		Date dateOfBirth;
		
Note:
		We can define a set of variables in a single statement as below.
		
		Ex:	
			string customerName, customerAddress, location, city;
			integer customerId, accountNumber;	
			Date dateOfBirth, joiningDate;		
		
Note: 
		Upon defining the variable, if the user didn't assigned the value, then salesforce will store "NULL" value by default.

		Ex:
			integer customerID;  --> Default value : Null
			string customerName; --> Default Value : Null
			
	Note: 
		Upon defining the variable, we can assign the value as below.

		Ex:
			integer customerID  = 1000001;
			string customerName = 'Pawan Kumar';
			
Note:
	1. Variable name should be always start with a character.
	2. We can not define two variable with the same name.	
	3. Varaible name should be a single word always. (It can have one special character "_")
	
	
Note: if the user, did not assign any value to the variable, then apex will assign "Null" value to the 
variable by default.
