Iterative and Looping statement
---------------------------------
Iterative statements are used to execute a set of statements iteratively upto the specific number of times.

We are used loop to execute a block of statement or code repetively.

Apex programming provides the below iterative statement
	1. While Statement
	2. Do while statement
	3. For Loop
	4. Enhanced For Loop

(1.) While loop: 
-----------------
While loop always check the condition first before execute the statement.
		
Once the statements has been executed , again it will verify the conditions and keep on executing the statement till the condition is satisfied.
		
Once the conditions get failed, it will stop executing the statements and comes out of the block.

		
	Syntax:	

	while(<condition>)
	{
		statement;
		....
		....
		....
	}


(2.) Do While loop: 
--------------------
Do while loop always execute the statement at least once and after that check the condition.
		
Once the statements has been executed , again it will verify the conditions and keep on executing the statement till the condition is satisfied.
		
Once the condition get failed, it will comes out of the blocks.
		
	
Syntax:

		do 
		{
			statement;
		} 
		while(<condition>);
		

(3.) For loop: 
----------------
For loop is used to execute a block of statement or code for a specific number of time. 

	Syntax:
		
		for (<initialization>; <condition>; <increment/ decrement>)
		{
			// Statement;
		} 



(4.) Enhanced For Loop: 
-----------------------
Locating the array elements based on the index position is very costly(i.e. in terms of Performance), which involves more operations.

to improve the performance of the application, upon managing the collections we have to use "Enhanced For Loop", which retrieves the elements very fastly.

Syntax:
	for(<Datatype> <referenceName> : <Collection Name>)
	{
		// Print the element values...
	}

Example:
	// defining array...
	integer[] customerIDs = new integer[]{100,456,23,4567,90};
	
	// printing the elements..
	
	for(integer ele : customerIDs)
	{
		system.debug('Element Value is...: '+ ele);
	}


Note: 
	Enhanced FOR loop will iterate the collection from starting to ending automatically.	
	
	
Ex:
	string[] names = new string[]{'Ramesh','Pawan','Karthik'};
	
	for(string st : names)
	{
		system.debug('Employee Names are...: '+ st);
	}
