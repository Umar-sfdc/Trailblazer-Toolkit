# Apex Introduction

This repository contains my personal notes, beginner-friendly examples, and practice exercises for understanding the **Apex programming language** in Salesforce.
These examples are designed to help you get started with Apex, covering the fundamentals like syntax, variables, control flow, data types, classes, objects, collections, SOQL, and basic DML operations.
Useful for building a strong foundation in Apex and gaining confidence to write custom logic on the Salesforce platform.
