Data Types
-----------

DataType describes 2 things as below:

	1. Describe, what type of data the variable can hold.
	2. To store the data in the variable, how much memory need to be required.
	
Note: 
	Apex programming is a Tightly Coupled Programming language, Hence we need to define the variables before its usage.

	We can define one or more variables in an application.
		
	
Apex provide two types of data types.

1. Premitive Datatypes:
-----------------------
	All the basic datatypes are referred as "Primitive Types".
	
	Ex:
		Integer, Long, Double, Decimal, String, Boolean, Byte, ID, Date, DateTime, Blob etc.
		
	Note:
		1. Primitive Datatypes supports Static memory allocation, as during the definition apex compiler will allocates required amount of memory to the variable.

		2. Primitive datatype values will get resides in "Stack" memory.
		 
		3. Primitive datatypes causes the memory wastage, as these are supporting static memory allocation.

2. SObject Datatypes
----------------------
	Each standard and Custom object in salesforce is referenced as "SObject"(Salesforce Object).
	
	For each standard and custom object in salesforce, force.com platform will allocated a readymade class with the same name as the object name.
	
	Ex:
		Object Name			Class Name
		-------------------------------
		Account Object	---> Account Class
		Contact Object	---> Contact Class
		Opportunity Object--> Opportunity Class
		Case Object 	---> Case Class
		Lead Object		---> Lead Class
		Campaign Object	---> Campaign Class
		Product2 Object	---> Product2 Class
		Task Object		---> Task Class.
		....
		...
		Position__C Object	---> Position__C class
		Candidate__C object	---> Candidate__C class.
		....
		....
		
	Note:
		1. SObject Datatypes supports Dynamic memory allocation.

		2. Sobject datatype values will get resides in "Heap" memory.
		 
		3. SObject Datatypes provides the efficient utilization of memory. Hence we can improve the application performance.
		
DataType
---------	
	
Integer:
--------
	It accepts only Integer values to store in the variable. It doesn't accept the Decimal point values.
	
	It occupies 4 byes of memory to store a single integer variable.
	
	We can store the values in between the Range from -2^32 to +2^32.
	
Long:
-----
	It is a 64 bit integer value which accepts only the Integer the values. Which doesn't accept Decimal points.
	
	It can store the values between the Range -2^64 to +2^64.
	
Decimal:
--------
	It accepts both integer values and decimal point values, which requires 8 bytes of memory to store the value.
	
	Note: 
		Each currency field will reference the "Decimal Datatype" by default.
	
Double:
-------
	It accepts both integer and decimal point values, which requires 8 bytes of memory.
	
	We can store max. of 18 digits after the decimal point.
	
Boolean:
--------
	By using this datatype, we can store True / False values inside the table column.
	
	Note: 
		Each "Checkbox" field will reference the "Boolean" datatype by default.

ID:
---
	By using this datatype, we can store an autogenerated 18 characters id of a record.
	
	
String:
-------
	By using this datatype, we can store one or more number of characters, which includes Alphabetical Characters, Numberical Numbers and special characters.
	
	Note: 
		Each character will occupy 2 bytes of memory internally.
	
	Note:
		Each Text Field, Text Area, Text Area Long, Text Area Rich, Text Encrypted, Email, Phone, Picklist, Picklist(Multiselect), URL fields will reference the "String Datatype" by default.
		
Date:
-----
	This field is used store Date values, which requires 8 bytes of memory.
	
	Note: 
		Each Date field (Ex: Open Date, Close Date) will reference the "Date" datatype by default.
	
	
DateTime:
---------
	This datatype is used to store both Date and Time values inside a variable.
	
	Each DateTime field will reference the DateTime datatype by default.
	
	Ex:
		CreatedDate, LastModifiedDate, etc.

		
Blob:(Binary Large Objects)
---------------------------
	This datatype is used to store the Binary Content generated from "Images / Files/ Pictures / Documents" etc.

	Each Blob Datatype can able to hold max. of 2 GB of content.
