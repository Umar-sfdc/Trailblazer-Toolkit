Procedural Programming / Structure Oriented Programming
--------------------------------------------------------

Each functionlaity of the application will be segrated into the small individuals pieces are called as "Procedural Programming".

Procedural function are comes under "Sub-Programs". Each procedure / function will have one or more statement to perform certain operation in the application.

Example:
		Basic, Pascal, C, ...etc
		
Drawback
--------
1. The data will be moving around the application, so there is no proper data secuirty.

2. We can not restrict the member inside the application. i.e (one function can invoke the other function inside the application).

To avoid the Data security problems, We have to use "Object Oriented Programming".
