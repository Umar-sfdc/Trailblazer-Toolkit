Operator:
-----------
Operator is nothing but a symbol, which performs operations on the operands.

Example: x + y, here is x & y is operand and + is operator.

Apex provides the below category of operators.

1. Arithmatic Operator:
------------------------
Arithmatic operation are used to perform arithmatic operation such as addition, subtraction, division, multiplication. 

Modulo return the reminder value when one number is divisible by another.
	
Example:
		Addition --> +
		Subtraction --> -
		Multuplication --> *
		Division --> /
		Reminder --> Math.Mod(Number, Number)

  
Note: 	When the addition operator (+) has been used between the string variable, then It will perform "Contactenation Operation".  


2. Relational / Comparison Operator: 
-------------------------------------
These are used to compare the two numerical values or string values.
	
Ex:
		Less Than --> <
		Greater Than --> >
		Less than or Equals --> <=
		Greater than or Equals --> >=
		Equals --> ==
		Not Equals --> !=
		
Note: 
	1. "==" operator will compare the values by using "Text Comparison"
		
	2. Equals() functions will compare the values by using "Binary Comparison"
		
		Ex:
			'Welcome' == 'welcome'  --> O/p: strings are Equals
			Equals() --> O/p: Strings are Not Equals.


3. Assignment Operator: 
-------------------------
These are used to assign the values to the variables.
	
Example:
		integer balanceAmount;
		
		1. =  
			balanceAmount = 40000;
			
		2. +=
			balanceAmount += 5000; 
				(i.e. balanceAmount = balanceAmount + 5000)
		3. -=
			balanceAmount -= 6000;
				(i.e. balanceAmount = balanceAmount - 6000)
		4. *=
			balanceAmount *= 4;
				(i.e. balanceAmount = balanceAmount * 4)
		5. /=
			balanceAmount /= 3;
				(i.e. balanceAmount = balanceAmount / 3)
		
		
4. Increment / Decrement Operators:
-------------------------------------
By using these operators, we can increment / decrement the values by 1.
	
Ex:
		++ --> Increments the value by 1.
		-- --> Decrement the value by 1.
	
	
(5.) Logical Operator: 
-----------------------
Logical operator are used to perform some logical operation such as And, Or, Not. 
			
Each logical operator will return boolean value (True / False) value as the result.
			
Apex provides three logical opertaor.
			
1. AND (&&):
	It returns TRUE, when all the specified conditions are satisfied. And returns False, if any of the condition fails.
		
2. OR (||):
	It returns TRUE, if any of the condition satisfied. And returns FALSE, if all the conditions are failed.
		
3. NOT (!):
	This operator is used to change the symbol from "TRUE to FALSE" and vice versa.
