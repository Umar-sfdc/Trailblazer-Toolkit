Access Sepcifiers:
-------------------
Access specifiers are used to define the level of access for each class and the class members.

We can define a seperate access specifier for each member in the class.


Apex provides 4 access specifiers as below.

1. Private:
------------
	This access specifier can be applicable for both class and the class members.
	
	Private members of the class can be accessible from within the class only. We can't access private members from outside of the class.
	
	Note:
		If the user didn't specify any access specifier upon defining a class member, then apex consider the member as a private by default. (i.e. All class members are private by default.)
	
	Ex:
		Public class SampleClass
		{
			Public string customerName; --> Public member
			Private integer accountBalance; --> Private member.
			string branchName; --> Private member..
		}	
	
2. Public:
------------
	Public members can be accessible within the class as well as outside of the class also within the entire salesforce application.
	
	Note: 
		We can't access the Public members from the Outside of the salesforce organization.

3. Protected:
--------------
	This access specifier will be used during the "Inheritance" feature.
	
	When the class members has been defined as "Protected", then the members can be accessible within the class and from all derived classes.
	
	Other classed in the application, cannot able to access the "Protected" members.
	
4. Global.
------------
	This access specifier is used to define the class members to be accessible from outside of the salesforce application.
	
	Global members can be accessible from within the class and outside of the class and outside of the salesforce application also.
	
	Note:
		All Webervice classes, API's, Batch Apex classes, Schedule Apex classes should be defined as "Global".
