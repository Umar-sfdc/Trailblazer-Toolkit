# Apex Triggers Notes

This repository contains my personal notes, examples, and best practices related to **Apex Triggers** in Salesforce.

From basic trigger structure to trigger context variables and real-world scenarios, these notes are written to help understand how and when to use triggers efficiently.

Great for learning, revising, or building trigger handler frameworks while developing Salesforce applications.
