Order Of execution
===================

1. The original record is loaded from the database (or initialized for an insert statement).

2. The new record field values are loaded from the request and overwrite the old values.

3. All before triggers execute (TRIGGERS)

4. System validation occurs, such as verifying that all required fields have a non-null value, and running any user-defined validation rules (User defined VALIDATIONS rule)

5. The record is saved to the database, but not yet committed.

6. All after triggers execute

7. Assignment rules execute

8. Auto-response rules execute

9. Workflow rules execute (WORKFLOW)

10. If there are workflow field updates, the record is updated again

11. If the record was updated with workflow field updates, before and after triggers fire one more time along with standard validation rule. In this case custom validation rule will not fire.  

12. Escalation rules execute

13. All DML operations are committed to the database

14. Post-commit logic executes, such as sending email
