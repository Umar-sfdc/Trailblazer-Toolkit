# Understanding Loops in Salesforce

In Salesforce, loops are used to iterate over collections like lists, sets, and maps or perform repetitive tasks until a condition is met. Apex, Salesforce’s programming language, supports three main types of loops:

## 1. **For Loop**
### Syntax:
```apex
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // code block to be executed
}
```

### Use Case:
When you know the exact number of iterations or need control over the iteration variables.

### Example:
```apex
// Print numbers from 1 to 5
for (Integer i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.debug('Number: ' + i);
}
```

## 2. **For-Each Loop**
### Syntax:
```apex
for (Type variable : collection) {
    // code block to be executed
}
```

### Use Case:
When iterating over a collection (e.g., a List, Set, or Map) without needing an index or performing manual increments.

### Example:
```apex
// Iterate over a list of names
List<String> names = new List<String>{'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'};
for (String name : names) {
    System.debug('Name: ' + name);
}
```

## 3. **While Loop**
### Syntax:
```apex
while (condition) {
    // code block to be executed
}
```

### Use Case:
When the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a condition.

### Example:
```apex
// Print numbers less than 5
Integer i = 1;
while (i < 5) {
    System.debug('Number: ' + i);
    i++;
}
```

## 4. **Do-While Loop**
### Syntax:
```apex
do {
    // code block to be executed
} while (condition);
```

### Use Case:
When you want the code block to execute at least once, even if the condition is false initially.

### Example:
```apex
// Print numbers starting from 1 until less than 5
Integer i = 1;
do {
    System.debug('Number: ' + i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
```

## Best Practices for Choosing a Loop

| **Loop Type**      | **When to Use**                                                                                          |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **For Loop**       | When you need precise control over the iteration variables, e.g., running a block of code 10 times.    |
| **For-Each Loop**  | When working with collections like Lists, Sets, or Maps, and you don’t need an index variable.         |
| **While Loop**     | When the condition is evaluated before execution, e.g., waiting for a dynamic state change.             |
| **Do-While Loop**  | When you need the loop to execute at least once, regardless of the condition.                           |

## Key Points
- Avoid infinite loops by ensuring proper conditions.
- Use bulkified code to process collections in Salesforce efficiently.
- Leverage the **for-each loop** for readability when working with collections.

By understanding and choosing the appropriate loop, you can write cleaner, more efficient Apex code in Salesforce.
