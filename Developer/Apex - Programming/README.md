# Apex Notes

This repository contains my personal notes and blogs related to **Salesforce Apex programming**.
Iâ€™ve written and collected these to better understand Apex concepts, triggers, SOQL, exception handling, and more.
These notes are helpful for quick revision, learning, and real-world Salesforce development.
