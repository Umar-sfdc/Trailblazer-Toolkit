# Day 03: Introduction to Fields, Objects, and Data Types in Salesforce  

Salesforce is built on a **data model architecture** that revolves around **objects**, **fields**, and **data types**. These elements form the foundation of how data is stored, organized, and managed in Salesforce.

## üîπ **Objects in Salesforce**  

An **object** in Salesforce is like a database table that stores data related to a specific entity. It consists of **fields** (columns) and **records** (rows).  

### Types of Objects  
1. **Standard Objects**  
   - Provided by Salesforce out-of-the-box.  
   - Examples:  
     - **Account**: Represents a company or organization.  
     - **Contact**: Represents individuals associated with an Account.  
     - **Opportunity**: Tracks potential sales deals.  

2. **Custom Objects**  
   - Created by users to store data specific to their business needs.  
   - Example:  
     - A company may create a **‚ÄúProject‚Äù** object to track ongoing projects.  

### Key Features of Objects  
- **Relationships**: Objects can relate to each other using relationships like Lookup or Master-Detail.  
- **Custom Fields**: Add fields to capture specific data relevant to your business.

## üîπ **Fields in Salesforce**  

Fields are the individual data points or attributes of an object. For example, in a **Contact** object, fields might include:

### Types of Fields

## üîπ Object Relationships  

Salesforce allows you to relate objects to each other to organize and connect data.  

### Types of Relationships  
1. **Lookup Relationship**

   - The child object inherits sharing and permissions from the parent.  
   - Example: Link an Invoice (child) to an Account (parent).  

3. **Many-to-Many Relationship**  
   - Created using a **junction object** to relate two objects.  
   - Example: Relating a Student to multiple Courses.

### Objects and Fields

## üîπ Summary  

- **Objects** are like tables that store data.  
- **Fields** are like columns that store individual attributes of the data.  
- **Data Types** define what kind of data each field can store.  

With a clear understanding of these fundamental elements, you can design powerful and efficient data models in Salesforce tailored to your business needs.
