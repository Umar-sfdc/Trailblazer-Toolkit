# **Day 16: Understanding Queues and Groups in Salesforce.**  

Imagine you and your friends are running a **pizza shop** üçï. You receive many **orders** every day, and you need a way to manage who will **handle each order**. **Salesforce Queues and Groups** work in a similar way to help distribute work among teams.

## **1. What is a Queue in Salesforce?**  

A **Queue** in Salesforce is like a **waiting area** where records (such as Cases, Leads, or Opportunities) are stored until a team member **picks them up and works on them**.  

### **How Queues Work?**  
- Queues hold records **until a user takes ownership**.  
- Multiple users can be assigned to a Queue, but **no single person owns the record** until they accept it.  
- Queues are mainly used for **Cases, Leads, Orders, and Custom Objects**.  

### **Pizza Shop Example: How Queues Work** üçï  
Imagine your pizza shop gets 50+ orders per hour. Instead of assigning orders to **specific employees**, you put them in a **queue (order screen)**, and anyone in the kitchen can **pick an order to prepare**.  

‚úÖ **Benefit:** No one gets overloaded, and work is distributed evenly!

## **2. What is a Group in Salesforce?**  

A **Group** in Salesforce is like a **team of people** who share access to records.  

### **Types of Groups in Salesforce:**  
1. **Public Groups** ‚Äì A collection of users, roles, or other groups. Used for **sharing records and granting access**.  
2. **Personal Groups** ‚Äì Created by users for **their own convenience** (rarely used).  

### **Pizza Shop Example: How Groups Work** üçï  
In your pizza shop, you have different **teams**:  
- **Chefs Group** ‚Äì Only chefs can access the kitchen.  
- **Delivery Group** ‚Äì Only delivery drivers can see customer addresses.  
- **Managers Group** ‚Äì Only managers can see sales reports.  

‚úÖ **Benefit:** You can control access to **who sees what data** without manually adding users every time.
