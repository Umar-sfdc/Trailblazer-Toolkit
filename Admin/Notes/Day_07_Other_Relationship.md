# Day 07: DaySalesforce Relationships Explained 

## üöÄ Overview
Salesforce provides various types of relationships to link objects together, making data more connected and powerful. Understanding these relationships is essential for building scalable and maintainable Salesforce applications.

### Key Relationships in Salesforce
1. **Lookup Relationship**
2. **Master-Detail Relationship**
3. **Hierarchy Lookup**
4. **External Lookup**

## üîç **Lookup Relationship**

### Definition
A **Lookup Relationship** links two objects in Salesforce. It is a loosely coupled relationship, meaning the parent and child objects are independent of each other.

- **Parent Deletion Impact**: Deleting the parent does not affect the child.
- **Use Case**: When the relationship is optional or when related records should remain even if the parent is deleted.

### Examples
1. **Simple**: A contact linked to an account for referencing purposes.
2. **Intermediate**: Linking a custom object like `Job Application` to a `Position` object.
3. **Advanced**: A `Case` object linked to multiple `Assets` for complex tracking.

## üîó **Master-Detail Relationship**

### Definition
A **Master-Detail Relationship** is a tightly coupled relationship where the child record depends on the parent record.

- **Parent Deletion Impact**: Deleting the parent deletes all related child records (cascade delete).
- **Sharing and Security**: Child inherits sharing and security settings from the parent.
- **Roll-Up Summary Fields**: Available to calculate aggregated values (e.g., sum, count) from the child records.

### Examples
1. **Simple**: A `Invoice` object as a child of the `Customer` object.
2. **Intermediate**: A `Line Item` object related to a `Sales Order` object.
3. **Advanced**: A `Project Milestone` object with a `Project` object to manage dependencies.

## üè¢ **Hierarchy Lookup**

### Definition
A **Hierarchy Lookup** is a special type of relationship available only for the `User` object. It allows creating a lookup relationship between users in a hierarchical structure (e.g., manager-subordinate relationships).

- **Use Case**: Defining roles or reporting hierarchies within an organization.

## üåê **Other Relationship Types**

### **External Lookup Relationship**

- **Definition**: Links an external object to a standard or custom object using a unique external ID.
- **Use Case**: Integrating Salesforce with external systems (e.g., ERP or database systems).

### **Indirect Lookup Relationship**

- **Definition**: Links an external object to a Salesforce object using an external ID.
- **Use Case**: Synchronizing data between Salesforce and external systems.

## ü§î Key Differences Between Lookup and Master-Detail

| Feature                  | Lookup Relationship                     | Master-Detail Relationship         |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Coupling**             | Loosely Coupled                         | Tightly Coupled                    |
| **Parent Deletion**      | No Impact on Child                      | Deletes Child Records              |
| **Sharing Settings**     | Independent                             | Inherited from Parent              |
| **Roll-Up Summary**      | Not Available                           | Available                          |
| **Required Field**       | Optional                                | Required                           |

## üö¶ When to Use

1. Use **Lookup Relationship** for loosely connected objects where data independence is required.
2. Use **Master-Detail Relationship** when child records are dependent on the parent and need roll-up calculations.
3. Use **Hierarchy Lookup** for user-based hierarchies.
