# **Day 17: Sharing Rules in Salesforce**

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ What are Sharing Rules?**
Sharing Rules in Salesforce are used to **automatically grant record access** to users or groups based on certain conditions. They help extend access beyond the default **Organization-Wide Defaults (OWD)** while maintaining security.

### **üîπ Why Do We Need Sharing Rules?**
- OWD settings might be **too restrictive** (e.g., Private).
- Some users **need access to records they don‚Äôt own**.
- Sharing Rules allow access **without changing roles or profiles**.

### **üîπ Key Features of Sharing Rules**
- **Only work when OWD is set to Private or Public Read-Only.**
- **Apply to specific users, roles, or public groups.**
- **Can grant Read-Only or Read/Write access.**
- **Cannot be stricter than OWD.**
