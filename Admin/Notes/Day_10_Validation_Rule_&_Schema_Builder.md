## üöÄ Overview
Schema Builder and Validation Rules are essential Salesforce tools for managing data structures and enforcing data integrity. They simplify object management and ensure data compliance with business rules.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Schema Builder**

### Definition
Schema Builder is a graphical interface in Salesforce that allows you to view, create, and modify objects, fields, and relationships. It provides a real-time, visual representation of your Salesforce data model.

### Key Features
- Drag-and-drop functionality for creating and editing objects and fields.
- Visualize relationships between objects (Lookup, Master-Detail, etc.).
- Provides access to field properties, record types, and field-level security.

### Limitations
- **Performance Issues**: Can be slow with complex data models or many objects.
- **No Advanced Customization**: Does not support editing formulas or triggers.
- **Limited to Metadata**: Cannot manage actual data or custom logic.

### Troublesome Scenarios
- **Overlapping Fields**: Misplaced relationships or duplicate fields can lead to confusion.
- **Performance in Large Orgs**: Viewing all objects in large organizations can become unwieldy.

### Examples
1. **Simple**: Create a new `Custom Object` and its fields using drag-and-drop.
2. **Intermediate**: Visualize the relationships between `Account`, `Contact`, and a custom `Order` object.
3. **Advanced**: Build a data model with complex relationships, including Lookup and Master-Detail fields, while ensuring all field dependencies are met.

## ‚úÖ **Validation Rules**

### Definition
Validation Rules are logical expressions in Salesforce that ensure data entered by users meets specified criteria before saving a record.

### Key Features
- Enforce specific business rules.
- Prevent invalid data from being saved.
- Use formulas to define criteria.

### Limitations
- **Complex Formulas**: Writing complex validation formulas can be challenging.
- **Triggers Conflicts**: May interfere with automation logic if not carefully planned.
- **User Experience**: Excessive rules can frustrate users with frequent errors.
- **Bulk Data Loads**: Validation rules can block data imports if records don‚Äôt meet the criteria.

### Troublesome Scenarios
- **Conflicting Rules**: Overlapping or conflicting rules can cause unintended validation failures.
- **Global Changes**: Broad rules can impact multiple processes unintentionally.

### Examples
1. **Simple**: Ensure a `Phone Number` field is filled in for `Leads`.
   ```
   ISBLANK(Phone)
   ```
2. **Intermediate**: Allow creation of an `Opportunity` only if the `Close Date` is in the future.
   ```
   CloseDate < TODAY()
   ```
3. **Advanced**: Validate that a custom `Discount` field does not exceed 20% unless approved.
   ```
   AND(Discount__c > 0.2, ISPICKVAL(Approval_Status__c, "Not Approved"))
   ```

## üö¶ When to Use

1. Use **Schema Builder** to design and modify the data model visually.
2. Use **Validation Rules** to enforce strict business requirements on data entry.
