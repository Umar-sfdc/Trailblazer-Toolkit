# **Day 18: Teams in Salesforce**  

## **1. What is a Team in Salesforce?**  
In Salesforce, a **Team** is a group of users who collaborate on a record, such as an **Account, Opportunity, or Case**. Teams help define the roles and responsibilities of different users working on the same record and control **record access**.  

Teams in Salesforce ensure that users with different job functions can contribute to a record while following access restrictions, maintaining security, and improving efficiency.

## **2. Types of Teams in Salesforce**  
Salesforce offers three main types of teams:  

### **2.1. Account Teams**  
📌 **Definition:**  
An **Account Team** is a group of users who work together on an Account record.  

📌 **Use Cases:**  
- A Sales Representative may involve different team members, such as Sales Engineers, Customer Success Managers, or Finance Managers, to help manage an Account.  
- It ensures that multiple users can collaborate on high-value accounts efficiently.  

📌 **Key Features:**  
- Defines different **roles** (e.g., Account Manager, Sales Engineer, Customer Success Rep).  
- Controls **record access** (Read/Write or Read-only).  
- Provides **default Account Teams** that can be added automatically.  
- Enables **reporting on team performance** using Account Team-related reports.  

📌 **How It Works:**  
- The **Account Owner** adds users to the Account Team.  
- Each member has a **specific role and level of access** (Read/Write or Read-only).  
- Salesforce provides a **Team-related list** on the Account page to manage team members.  
- Users can create a **Default Account Team**, which can be automatically added to new accounts.  

📌 **Limitations:**  
- No direct influence on related **Opportunities, Cases, or Contacts**; access needs to be granted separately.  
- Not available in **Salesforce Essentials edition**.

### **2.2. Opportunity Teams (Sales Teams)**  
📌 **Definition:**  
An **Opportunity Team** (also known as a Sales Team) is a group of users collaborating on an Opportunity.  

📌 **Use Cases:**  
- A Sales Executive works on a large deal and needs a **Sales Engineer, Legal Advisor, and Finance Manager** to assist.

- Helps track **team contributions and deal progression** in reports.  

📌 **How It Works:**

- Users can create reports to track **team performance on deals**.  

📌 **Limitations:**

📌 **Definition:**  
A **Case Team** consists of users who collaborate on resolving a **Customer Support Case**.  

📌 **Use Cases:**

- Controls **record access** (Read/Write or Read-only).  
- Enables better **case resolution tracking**.  
- Allows **Case Comments and Case Feed** for better communication.  

📌 **How It Works:**

## **3. Why Use Teams in Salesforce?**  
### ✅ **Advantages of Using Teams**  
✔ **Better Collaboration** → Ensures different users can contribute effectively.  
✔ **Improved Access Control** → Provides controlled access without giving full ownership.  
✔ **Streamlined Workflows** → Assigns clear roles and responsibilities.  
✔ **Better Reporting** → Helps in tracking team contributions and performance.  
✔ **Enhanced Customer Experience** → Ensures smooth handling of Accounts, Opportunities, and Cases.  

### ❌ **Limitations & Challenges**  
❌ **Manual Setup** → Users need to add team members manually unless using Default Teams.  
❌ **Limited Automation** → No automatic role assignment based on predefined criteria.  
❌ **Restricted Editions** → Not available in all Salesforce editions.  
❌ **No Hierarchical Sharing** → Teams do not inherit sharing from parent records automatically.  

---

## **4. How Teams Work Behind the Scenes in Salesforce?**  
Salesforce uses **Object Sharing and Record-Level Access** to manage Team functionalities:  

1. **Sharing Rules & Role Hierarchy**  
   - Team members get access based on **roles and sharing settings**.  
   - Access levels are controlled using **OWD (Organization-Wide Defaults)** and **Sharing Rules**.  

2. **Data Model (Underlying Objects)**  
   - Teams are **related lists** stored in objects like **AccountTeamMember, OpportunityTeamMember, CaseTeamMember**.  
   - These objects link users to parent records while defining **role-based access**.  

3. **Default Teams & Automation**  
   - **Default Teams** are stored in **User Preferences** and applied automatically.  
   - **Flows, Apex Triggers, or Process Builder** can automate team assignment based on conditions.

## **5. Alternatives to Salesforce Teams**  
If Teams do not fit your requirements, consider:  

### **🔹 Salesforce Queues**  
- Used for record assignment instead of collaboration.  
- Best for Cases, Leads, or Custom Objects that need a work queue.  

### **🔹 Public Groups & Sharing Rules**  
- Used for broader access rather than specific record-based collaboration.  
- Best for granting access to multiple records at once.  

### **🔹 Einstein Relationship Insights (for Advanced Collaboration)**  
- AI-powered insights for better teamwork on strategic accounts.
